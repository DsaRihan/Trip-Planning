# Trip Planning React App

## Overview

The Trip Planning React App is a simple yet engaging application designed to help users plan their trips by browsing through a collection of cards, each representing a different travel destination. Each card contains a picture and a description of the place. Users can indicate that they are not interested in a particular destination by pressing the "Not Interested" button, which will remove the card from the view. If all cards are removed, a "Refresh" button will appear to allow users to reset the page to its initial state with all cards displayed again.

## Features

- **Interactive Cards**: Each card contains a picture and a description of a travel destination.
- **Not Interested Button**: Allows users to remove a card from the view.
- **Refresh Button**: Appears when all cards have been removed, enabling users to reset the page and view all cards again.
